# 👋 Hi, I'm Gabriel

I am a **backend developer** with over 3 years of experience building, maintaining, and evolving backend systems and APIs used in production environments.

My work is primarily focused on **C# / .NET** and **Java (Spring Boot)**, developing RESTful services, integrating relational databases, and contributing to backend architectures. Throughout my career, I have worked on real-world projects from early architectural decisions through delivery and production support.

I have hands-on experience with:
- **REST API development**
- **Relational database modeling and integration**
- **Docker** and **CI/CD pipelines**
- **Cloud infrastructure (AWS)**
- **Linux environments and server configuration**

I have also worked with other technologies as required by different projects, which helped me build a broader understanding of software development. However, my main and current focus is on **backend development** and **service-oriented architectures**.
